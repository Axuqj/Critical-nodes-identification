# Critical-nodes-identification

Topology-based heuristics for critical nodes identification.

本文提出一种基于网络拓扑结构的关键节点挖掘算法。

Topology-based-heuristics.py  is the proposed method.

CBG-PylouvainTest.py is the experiment code of  the proposed method, whicth can conduct all kinds of experiments to vertify the effect of the method.

K-Shell-for-CNP.py   is the KSBG method.

KS-test.py is to test the KSBG method.

As above, other files are the methods and their experiments.
