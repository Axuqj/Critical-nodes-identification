# Critical-nodes-identification

Topology-based heuristics for critical nodes identification.

本文提出一种基于网络拓扑结构的关键节点挖掘算法。

The files include the codes of all the methods for CNP and all the experiments.

Every method is linked to the experimental codes, and called with "test".

They are:

Topology-based-heuristics.py  is the proposed method.

CBG-PylouvainTest.py is the experiment code of  the proposed method, whicth can conduct all kinds of experiments to vertify the effect of the method.

K-Shell-for-CNP.py   is the KSBG method.

KS-test.py is to test the KSBG method.

As above, other files are the codes of methods and their experiments.

generate_SBM.m   generates the SBM model.

generate_RN.m  generates the RN model.
